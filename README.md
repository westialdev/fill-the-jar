Fill the jar Dojo
=================

This repository is a consecutive git commits based on a step-by-step dojo to
practice test driven development. 

It provides a closure multiple, quite diverse and unusual implementation of the
same use case.

This project has been created for a special Leadtech's middle end team speech 
although it is thought as dojo-like session as well.
